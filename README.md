# Query-a-Digital-Music-Store-Database
Project Introduction
Chinook Database
Introduction
In this project, you will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the Chinook Database is provided below. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.


Project Overview
All of the instructions are discussed in detail as you work through this lesson on your way to completing this project.

Instructions
Step 1: Get the Chinook database up and running.
You can run the DB Browser database on your own machine (See the Set Up the DB Browser Database page) or you can use the provided workspace (see the Chinook Postgres SQL Workspace page).

Step 2: Complete the SQL Question Sets
This series of questions will confirm that you have mastered the main concepts taught throughout the SQL lessons. These questions will not be "graded" by a reviewer and are intended to help you self-assess.

Step 3: Create the Presentation
There isn't a 'right answer' for this portion of the project. The project is designed to allow you to be creative in the questions you ask and then write a SQL query to pull the data needed to answer your question successfully.
